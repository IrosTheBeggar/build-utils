- Package task building functionality into build-utils? This will remove the
    need to have a local install of gulp/ansi-colors/etc.
    OR
- Include fancy-log/ansi-colors/etc. as peer dependencies

- Create an auto-loader that detects and initializes the correct factory based
    on build metadata
